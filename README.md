## **About**

</br>

This repository is related to the course Data Science Engineering Tools and Methods at Northeastern University.

The primary dataset is **Mobile Price Classification** from Kaggle, in which the aim is to predict the class of price range for a mobile phone based on hardware features like RAM, battery power, clock speed, internal memory, and other features.

This repository contains different Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a specific process performed on the dataset.

The processes performed on the primary dataset include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. AutoML
3. Interpretability

A compiled report of the above processes performed on the dataset is also included in the repository.

The repository also contains a notebook for character recognition performed on the **TMNIST Alphabet (94 characters)** dataset from Kaggle. This operation was performed using a Convolutional Neural Network.

Finally, this repository includes a notebook for a crash course in Statistical Learning, specifically SHAP Analysis. In this notebook, there is a detailed explanation of SHAP and SHAP analysis using the primary dataset, Mobile Price Classification.

There is also a notebook for worked examples of SHAP analysis using AutoML, which explains the process of using AutoML to find the best model for a dataset and then performing SHAP analysis on the selected model. In this notebook, apart from the primary dataset, the **Iris Dataset** from UCI is also used, which predicts the class of Iris flowers based on sepal and petal lengths and widths.
